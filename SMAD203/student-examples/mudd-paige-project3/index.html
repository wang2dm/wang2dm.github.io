      <h2>about me</h2>
      <p>Hi there! I'm Paige, a sophomore at James Madison University. I am a double major in Media Arts & Design (SMAD) and Theatre Design. I have experience with visual design for the web and stage. Some things I enjoy studying are history, literature, music, communications, machinery, electronics, and how things work. I lovee bullet journaling, drawing, spending time with friends, editing videos, and talking to people. My favorite thing right now is finding a good place outside to read or draw.</p>

      <h2>& my work</h2>
      <p>As a designer, I challenge myself to be versatile in what I create for others. I have experience with designing for print, screen, and the web. I have film experience, both in the production phase and the post-production aspects, with over seven years of editing experience under my belt. In the past, I designed the website for <a href="http://dentremoversva.com">Dent Removers RVA</a> and designed logos for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hannahbracelets_/">Hannah's Bracelets</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/divinesacredgifts/">Divine Sacred Gifts</a>. Currently, I serve as the digital editor for scratch pad, the student ad agency at James Madison University, and I am a member of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jmustad/">Theatre and Dance</a> social media team for James Madison University, with an emphasis on task management and content creation. My organizational skills and task-driven nature help the social media team run smoothly and ensures that we are staying on track.</p>

      <p>Looking to the future, I want to make fun, effective designs that tell a story and make a positive impact on the world. As a positive person myself, my art should reflect the type of things I want to see in the world.</p>
